## The purpose of this project is to design and analyze a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm for a Photovoltaic(PV) system using an Artificial Neural Network(ANN) Model.
### The ANN is intended to learn the non- linear relationship between environmental factors (irradiance and temperature) and the corresponding values of Panel voltages and currents. The result of the ANN model is compared to the outcome of the traditional Perturb and Observe(P&O) Method.
