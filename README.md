## The purpose of this project is to design and analyze a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm for a Photovoltaic(PV) system using an Artificial Neural Network(ANN) Model.
### The ANN is intended to learn the non- linear relationship between environmental factors (irradiance and temperature) and the corresponding values of Panel voltages and currents. The result of the ANN model is compared to the outcome of the traditional Perturb and Observe(P&O) Method. 


### Traditional Methods Used for Maximum Power Point Tracking(MPPT) of PV Panels include:
    #### 1. Incremental Conductance(INC) Method 
    #### 2. Constant Voltage(CV) Method
    #### 3. Constant Current(CC) or Short-Circuit Current Method
    #### 4. Hill Climbing Method (Similar to P&O but perturbation is directly applied to duty cycle)
    #### 5. Fractional Open-Circuit Voltage (FOCV) Method
    #### 6. Fractional Short-Circuit Current (FSSC) Method
    #### 7. Feedback Voltage (FB) Method 
    #### 8. Temperature-based Method 
    #### 9. Look-Up Table (LUT) Method
    #### 10. Load-Line (LL) Method
